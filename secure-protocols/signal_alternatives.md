# A Guide to Signal Alternatives: Session & Briar

Signal is excellent, but specialized situations demand specialized tools. This guide covers two alternatives for high-stakes scenarios.

*   **Session**: Use when your primary threat is **anonymity** (hiding your identity).
*   **Briar**: Use when your primary threat is **network failure** (internet/cell shutdown).

## 1. Session: The Anonymous Messenger

*   **Core Technology:** Uses a decentralized onion routing network (similar to Tor) to hide your IP address. It does **not** require a phone number, using a randomly generated Session ID instead.
*   **Setup & OPSEC:**
    1.  Create your ID. **Securely back up your recovery phrase offline.** Losing this phrase means losing your account forever.
    2.  Be aware of the trade-offs: messages are slower than Signal, but provide a much higher degree of anonymity.

## 2. Briar: The Resilient Messenger

*   **Core Technology:** A peer-to-peer messenger with no central server. It can sync messages directly between phones using **Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi**, bypassing the internet entirely.
*   **Setup & OPSEC:**
    1.  Create your account and set a strong password. **There is no password recovery.**
    2.  **Add contacts in person by scanning QR codes.** This is the most secure method and is core to Briar's security model.
    3.  Use the 'Blogs' and 'Forums' features for secure one-to-many communication within your trusted, offline group.
