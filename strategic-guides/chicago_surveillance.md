# A Guide to Law Enforcement Surveillance in Chicago for Activists

This guide provides a detailed overview of the surveillance technologies used by law enforcement in Chicago. It is intended to be a resource for activists, journalists, and the public to understand the city's surveillance infrastructure and its legal implications.

## 1. CCTV Network: Operation Virtual Shield & Project Shield

Chicago's CCTV network is one of the most extensive in the world. It is a combination of public and private cameras integrated into a single system managed by the Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC).

*   **Operation Virtual Shield:** This is the city's network of thousands of publicly owned cameras, strategically placed throughout the city.
*   **Project Shield (Private Sector Camera Initiative):** This program allows private businesses and organizations to link their camera systems into the OEMC's network. This public-private partnership dramatically expands the city's surveillance capabilities, giving law enforcement access to a vast web of cameras they do not own or directly control.

### How it's Used

The integrated camera network is used for a variety of purposes, including:

*   **Real-time monitoring:** The OEMC can monitor events as they unfold, from protests to street festivals.
*   **Criminal investigations:** Footage from the network is used to identify suspects and gather evidence.
*   **Traffic management:** The cameras are also used to monitor traffic flow and respond to accidents.

### Legal Implications: Illinois Eavesdropping Law

The **Illinois Eavesdropping Law** is a "two-party consent" law, meaning it is generally illegal to record a private conversation without the consent of all parties. However, the law was amended to allow for the recording of on-duty police officers in public. This is a critical protection for activists who wish to document police activity, including their use of surveillance technology.

*   **Practical Advice:** When recording police, it is important to do so openly and to not interfere with their duties. While you have the right to record, police may still try to intimidate or arrest you. It is important to know your rights and to have a plan in place in case of an encounter with law enforcement.

## 2. ShotSpotter Technology

ShotSpotter is an acoustic gunshot detection system that uses a network of microphones to detect and locate gunfire. The system is designed to alert police to shootings in real-time, even if no one calls 911.

### Coverage and Controversy

ShotSpotter has been deployed in several Chicago neighborhoods, primarily on the South and West Sides. However, the technology is highly controversial for several reasons:

*   **Accuracy:** Studies have shown that ShotSpotter has a high rate of false positives, meaning it often alerts police to sounds that are not gunfire. This can lead to unnecessary and potentially dangerous police deployments.
*   **Racial Bias:** The placement of ShotSpotter sensors in predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods has led to accusations of racial bias and over-policing.
*   **Use as Evidence:** The use of ShotSpotter data as evidence in court is also controversial, as the system's accuracy and reliability have been called into question.

### Legal Implications: Illinois Eavesdropping Law

While the Eavesdropping Law primarily applies to conversations, the use of ShotSpotter raises questions about the reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces. The constant monitoring of sounds in a neighborhood could be seen as a form of mass surveillance.

*   **Practical Advice:** Activists can use the public debate around ShotSpotter to advocate for greater transparency and accountability in the use of surveillance technology. This includes demanding data on the system's accuracy and its impact on communities of color.

## 3. Facial Recognition

The Chicago Police Department (CPD) uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals by comparing images from various sources against a database of known faces.

### How it's Used

The CPD uses facial recognition in a variety of ways, including:

*   **Identifying suspects:** The technology is used to compare images from CCTV cameras, social media, and other sources against a database of mugshots and other images.
*   **Generating leads:** Facial recognition can be used to identify potential witnesses or associates of a suspect.

### Databases and Technology

The CPD has used a variety of facial recognition technologies, including the controversial **Clearview AI**, which scrapes images from social media and other public websites. This practice has raised serious privacy concerns, as it allows law enforcement to build a massive database of faces without the consent of the individuals pictured.

### Legal Implications: Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)

The **Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)** is one of the strongest biometric privacy laws in the country. It requires private entities to obtain informed consent before collecting, using, or storing biometric information, including facial scans. While BIPA does not directly apply to law enforcement, it can be used to hold private companies like Clearview AI accountable for their role in government surveillance.

*   **Practical Advice:** BIPA provides a powerful tool for activists to challenge the use of facial recognition technology. By filing lawsuits against the private companies that provide this technology to law enforcement, activists can disrupt the surveillance-industrial complex and protect the privacy of all Illinoisans.

## 4. CLEAR Database & Predictive Policing

The CPD uses a variety of data-driven tools to predict where crime is likely to occur and who is likely to be involved. While the specific term "CLEAR" is not always used, the concept of a consolidated database for predictive policing is a reality in Chicago.

### What it is and How it's Used

These systems, such as the now-defunct "Strategic Subject List," use historical data on arrests, gang affiliations, and other factors to assign individuals a risk score. This information is then used to target individuals for increased police scrutiny.

### Legal Implications

Predictive policing raises serious concerns about due process, equal protection, and the presumption of innocence. By targeting individuals based on their past associations and activities, these systems can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to increased arrests and incarceration in already over-policed communities.

*   **Practical Advice:** Activists can challenge the use of predictive policing by demanding transparency in how these systems are used and by advocating for policies that invest in communities rather than in more policing.

## 5. Cell-Site Simulators (Stingrays)

Cell-site simulators, also known as Stingrays, are devices that mimic cell phone towers to trick phones in a certain area into connecting to them. This allows law enforcement to track the location of phones and, in some cases, to intercept communications.

### How they are Used

The CPD has a long and secretive history of using Stingrays. These devices can be used to track the location of a known suspect's phone or to identify all the phones in a particular area, such as at a protest.

### Legal Implications

The use of Stingrays raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, as it allows law enforcement to conduct a general search of all phones in a given area without a warrant. The secrecy surrounding the use of this technology also makes it difficult for the public to hold the police accountable.

*   **Practical Advice:** Activists can work to expose the use of Stingrays by filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and by supporting legislation that would require a warrant for their use.

## 6. Protecting Household Privacy Act (PHPA)

The **Illinois Protecting Household Privacy Act (PHPA)** is a state law that requires law enforcement to obtain a warrant before accessing data from smart devices in a home. This includes devices like smart speakers, smart TVs, and home security cameras.

### How it Protects Against Surveillance

The PHPA provides an important layer of protection against government surveillance in the home. By requiring a warrant, the law ensures that law enforcement cannot access the vast amounts of data collected by smart devices without probable cause.

*   **Practical Advice:** While the PHPA provides important protections, it is still important to be mindful of the data that is collected by smart devices. Activists should take steps to secure their home networks and to limit the amount of data that is shared with third-party companies.

## Conclusion and Actionable Advice for Activists

Chicago's surveillance infrastructure is vast and complex. However, by understanding the technologies that are being used and the legal frameworks that govern them, activists can work to protect their privacy and to hold law enforcement accountable. Here are some key takeaways:

*   **Know your rights:** You have the right to record police in public, and you have the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
*   **Demand transparency:** The public has a right to know how surveillance technologies are being used and what impact they are having on our communities.
*   **Support legislation:** There are a number of bills that have been introduced in the Illinois legislature that would strengthen privacy protections and increase police accountability.
*   **Build power:** The most effective way to challenge the surveillance state is to build a broad-based movement for social and racial justice.
