# Guide: Combating Government Surveillance

This is a strategic guide to building resilience against state-level surveillance. It's not about a single tool, but a mindset and a methodology.

1.  **Minimize Your Digital Footprint:** The less data that exists about you, the less can be collected. Practice data minimization. Don't sign up for services you don't need. Use aliases. Don't post personal information online.
2.  **Assume You Are Monitored:** Operate as if your communications could be intercepted. This encourages good security practices. Use end-to-end encryption (Signal, Session) for everything sensitive. Never discuss illegal activity on any electronic device.
3.  **Compartmentalize:** Don't use the same phone, email, or identity for your activism as you do for your personal life. This creates a barrier that makes it harder for an investigation into one part of your life to spill over into the other.
4.  **Understand Parallel Construction:** Law enforcement may use secret surveillance methods and then recreate the evidence trail using conventional methods to hide their original source in court. The only defense is to not create the evidence in the first place. This is why encryption and leaving no trace (Tails) are so important.
5.  **Build a Culture of Security:** Security is a team sport. Educate your group. Establish secure communication protocols. Decide as a group what your threat model is and what level of security you need. A single person's mistake can compromise everyone.
