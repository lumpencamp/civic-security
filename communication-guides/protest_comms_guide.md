# Advanced Guide to Protest Communications

Effective and secure communication is the nervous system of any successful protest or direct action. This guide provides a detailed overview of the methods, equipment, and best practices required to maintain coordination and safety in a contested environment.

### **Section 1: Core Principles & Threat Model**

**Goals of Protest Comms:**
1.  **Coordination:** Directing movement, sharing updates, and coordinating actions between different groups.
2.  **Safety & Support:** Reporting injuries, requesting medical aid, warning of police movements, and coordinating jail support.
3.  **Documentation:** Securely transmitting photos, videos, and notes to off-site media or legal teams.

**Primary Threats:**
1.  **Interception:** Law enforcement or adversaries listening to your communications.
2.  **Disruption:** The jamming or shutdown of cellular and internet services.
3.  **Identification:** Using your communication methods to identify you and your network of associates.

### **Section 2: Essential Equipment**

*   **Burner Phone:** A simple, inexpensive phone purchased with cash and used only for protest-related activities. It should not be linked to your real identity.
*   **Portable Battery Packs (Power Banks):** Your devices are useless if they are dead. Carry at least one fully charged power bank.
*   **Mesh Networking Devices (e.g., goTenna Mesh):** These devices create a private, peer-to-peer network that does not rely on cell towers or Wi-Fi. They are excellent for off-grid team communication.
*   **Handheld Radios (e.g., Baofeng UV-5R):** While communications are not encrypted and can be easily monitored, radios are a reliable, one-to-many broadcast tool that is very difficult to jam. They are best for public announcements (e.g., "Police are moving north on Clark Street"), not sensitive coordination.

### **Section 3: Communication Methods**

#### **Digital & Encrypted (When Internet is Available)**

*   **Signal (Primary Tool):**
    *   **Setup:** Use a burner phone number if possible. Enable **Registration Lock** to prevent account hijacking. Set a strong screen lock PIN.
    *   **Best Practices:** Set all messages to **disappear** (1 hour is a good default for an active event). **Verify safety numbers** with your key contacts before the event. **Disable link previews** to prevent leaking your IP address.

*   **Briar (Resilient & Offline):**
    *   **How it Works:** Briar is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging app that can sync directly between phones using Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi, bypassing the internet entirely. It can also use the Tor network if internet is available.
    *   **Use Case:** This is the **gold standard for communication during an internet shutdown**. It allows you to maintain a secure, local communication network with trusted contacts.

#### **Analog & Low-Tech (When All Else Fails)**

*   **Runners:** Designated individuals who physically carry messages between different groups. They should be fit, know the area well, and be inconspicuous.
*   **Hand Signals:** Pre-arranged, simple hand signals for common commands (e.g., advance, retreat, medic needed). This is silent, unjammable, and fast.
*   **Written Notes:** Use paper and pencil. Messages should be short, clear, and destroyed after being read.

### **Section 4: Best Practices & OPSEC**

*   **Communication Discipline:**
    *   **Keep it Brief:** Transmit only essential information. The less you say, the less can be intercepted.
    *   **Be Clear:** Use simple, unambiguous language.
    *   **Authenticate:** Before acting on a message, have a simple way to authenticate that it came from a trusted source (e.g., asking a pre-arranged challenge question).

*   **Use of Code Words:**
    *   Develop a simple, pre-arranged set of code words for common locations, actions, and roles. Avoid overly complex codes that can be forgotten under stress.
    *   **Example:** "The library is open" could mean "The safe house is ready." "Rain" could mean "Police presence increasing."

*   **Radio Discipline (if using radios):**
    *   Assume everyone can hear you. Never transmit sensitive information.
    *   Keep transmissions short to avoid being located via radio direction finding (RDF).
    *   Use a designated channel and have backup channels planned.

*   **Establish a Comms Team:**
    *   For larger actions, designate a small, trusted team to handle communications. This team is responsible for monitoring all channels, relaying information, and maintaining the security of the network.
    *   This centralizes information flow and reduces the chance of conflicting or confusing messages.
