# Guide: Signal Messenger

**Why Signal?** Signal uses end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls, meaning only you and the recipient can read them. It's open-source and run by a non-profit.

**Key Settings for Security:**
1.  **Registration Lock:** Set a PIN to prevent others from registering your number on a new device. (Settings > Account > Registration Lock)
2.  **Screen Lock:** Require a password, PIN, or biometric to open the app. (Settings > Privacy > Screen Lock)
3.  **Disappearing Messages:** Set messages to auto-delete after a certain time for sensitive conversations. (Inside a chat > Chat Settings > Disappearing Messages)
4.  **Turn off Link Previews:** Prevent Signal from fetching a preview of links you send. (Settings > Privacy > Generate link previews)
