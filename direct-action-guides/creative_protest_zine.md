## Protesting with Banknotes

*   **Write:** Write slogans like "Free Palestine" on currency that circulates across borders.
*   **Stamp:** Use stamps to print messages on banknotes, like Alexei Navalny's campaign to stamp "United Russia is a party of crooks and thieves" on rubles.
*   **Print:** Print infographics directly onto currency, like the Occupy George project, which printed wealth inequality stats on dollar bills.

## Other Ways to Protest Using Money

*   **Move It:** Organize mass account closures from commercial banks, moving money to member-owned credit unions.
*   **Make Change:** Pay fines or debts in inconvenient forms, like the man who paid a $150,000 settlement in 3.6 tonnes of coins.
*   **Print Your Own:** When a small Italian town was forced to merge, it protested by declaring independence and creating its own currency, the Fiorito.
*   **Burn It:** Publicly burn money to protest economic inequality, like the Swedish Feminist Initiative barbecuing 100,000 krona to represent the gender wage gap.

## How to Attack Surveillance Cameras ('Camover')

*These tactics describe property destruction and may carry serious legal consequences.*

*   **Beat It:** Use a long, strong stick to knock cameras off their posts or break them.
*   **Snare It:** Use a rope with a heavy weight to throw over a camera, form a noose, and yank it down.
*   **Tape It Over:** Apply opaque tape to the lens of low-hanging cameras.
*   **Bag It, Blind It:** Glue a plastic bag over a camera. Paint is also effective for blinding the lens.
*   **Cut the Power:** Use a sharp hand axe or garden shears to cut a camera's power cables. Wear heavy-duty gloves.
*   **Laser Dazzling:** Powerful laser pointers can temporarily blind CCTV cameras from a distance.
*   **Block Drop:** Climb to the roof above a camera and drop heavy weights on it.

*   **Bomb Slingshot:** Use giant slingshots to launch projectiles.
*   **Wheelbarrow Cannon:** Construct a cannon from pipes and a wheelbarrow.
*   **Glitter Bomb:** Use an air horn and a test tube to create a glitter bomb for non-violent disruption.
*   **Mattress Shield:** Use mattress foam and corkboard to create a soft shield.
