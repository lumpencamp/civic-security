# Guide: GrapheneOS

GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system with great functionality and usability. It is a hardened fork of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is considered the gold standard for mobile device security.

**How it Works:**
*   **Hardened Security:** GrapheneOS is developed with a focus on hardening the base Android system against exploitation. It includes a hardened kernel, a hardened C standard library, and a hardened memory allocator.
*   **Privacy by Default:** GrapheneOS does not include Google Play Services by default, which are a major source of data collection. It also includes a number of privacy-enhancing features, such as a network permission toggle for all apps.

### **Supported Devices**

GrapheneOS has very strict hardware security requirements. As a result, it **only officially supports Google Pixel phones**.

As of mid-2025, this generally includes:
*   Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 8a
*   Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7a
*   Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6a
*   Pixel 5, Pixel 5a
*   Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a

*Always check the official [GrapheneOS releases page](https://grapheneos.org/releases) for the most current list before purchasing a device.*
