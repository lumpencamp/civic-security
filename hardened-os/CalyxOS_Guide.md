# Guide: CalyxOS

CalyxOS is a privacy-focused mobile operating system based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). It is designed to be a more user-friendly alternative to GrapheneOS, while still providing a high level of privacy and security.

**How it Works:**
*   **microG:** CalyxOS includes microG, a free and open-source implementation of Google Play Services. This allows users to run many apps that rely on Google services without having to install the official, privacy-invasive Google Play Services.
*   **Privacy by Default:** CalyxOS includes a number of privacy-enhancing features by default, such as the CalyxVPN, the Datura firewall, and a number of privacy-focused apps.

### **Supported Devices**

CalyxOS supports a wider range of devices than GrapheneOS, prioritizing models that allow for bootloader relocking.

As of mid-2025, this includes:
*   **Google Pixel:** Pixel 4 through Pixel 8 series.
*   **Fairphone:** Fairphone 4 and Fairphone 5.
*   **Motorola:** Select models like the Moto G34, G42, G54.

*The list changes frequently. Always check the official [CalyxOS device support page](https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support/) for the most current list and support timeline.*
