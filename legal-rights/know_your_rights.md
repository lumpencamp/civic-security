### **1. The Three Magic Phrases**

In almost any police interaction, these three phrases are your most powerful tools:

1.  **"Am I free to leave?"**
2.  **"I am going to remain silent."**
3.  **"I want a lawyer."**

Memorize them. Use them.

### **2. Your Right to Remain Silent (5th Amendment)**

You have the right to not answer questions from law enforcement. This applies whether you are just being questioned on the street or if you are under arrest.

*   **How to Use It:** State clearly and calmly, **"Officer, I am going to remain silent. I want a lawyer."** After you say this, you must actually remain silent. Don't be tricked into a casual conversation.
*   **Why It's Important:** Anything you say can and will be used against you. Police are allowed to lie to you to get you to talk. The only way to be safe is to say nothing until you have a lawyer present.
*   **Identifying Information:** In Illinois, if you are being detained or arrested, you may be required to provide your name and address. You do not have to answer any other questions about where you are going, where you are coming from, or what you are doing.

### **3. Your Right to Refuse Searches (4th Amendment)**

You have the right to refuse a search of your person, your bag, your car, or your home.

*   **How to Use It:** If an officer asks to search your belongings, state clearly, **"Officer, I do not consent to a search."**
*   **If They Search Anyway:** Do not physically resist the search, as this can lead to new charges. Just repeat, **"I do not consent to this search."** This makes it clear that the search is non-consensual, which is crucial for your lawyer later.
*   **When Can They Search?**
    *   If they have a **warrant**.
    *   If you are under **arrest**, they can search your person and the area immediately around you.
    *   If they have **"probable cause"** to believe you have committed a crime (this is a complex legal standard, which is why you should always refuse consent).

### **4. Your Right to Film Police**

In Illinois, you have a clear right to record on-duty police officers in public.

*   **The Law:** The Illinois Eavesdropping Act was changed to explicitly allow individuals to record on-duty police in public spaces. You are legally allowed to film or audio-record police as long as you are not interfering with their duties.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Film from a safe distance.
    *   Do not interfere with the officers' movements or actions.
    *   If they tell you to stop recording, you can state, **"I am lawfully recording in a public space and I am not interfering."**
    *   Narrate the video. State the date, time, location, and what you are seeing (badge numbers, patrol car numbers, number of officers, etc.).

### **5. If You Are Arrested in Chicago**

1.  **Do Not Resist:** Do not physically resist arrest, even if you believe it is unjust. This will only lead to more serious charges.
2.  **Remain Silent:** Immediately state, **"I am going to remain silent. I want a lawyer."** Do not talk to police in the car or at the station.
3.  **Do Not Consent to Searches:** Repeat **"I do not consent to any searches."**
4.  **Call a Lawyer:** You have the right to make a phone call. Your first call should be to a lawyer or one of the legal hotlines. If you can't get through, call your designated jail support contact.
    *   **FDLA (800-529-7374)** provides free legal representation at Chicago police stations 24/7.
5.  **Do Not Talk to Anyone About Your Case:** This includes cellmates. Only talk to your lawyer.
