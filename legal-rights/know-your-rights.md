# Guide: Know Your Rights

- **You have the right to remain silent.** If you are detained or arrested, you can and should tell police you are exercising your right to remain silent and wish to speak with a lawyer.
- **You do not have to consent to a search** of yourself or your belongings. Police may pat you down for weapons if they have a reason to believe you are armed and dangerous, but they cannot go through your pockets without consent or a warrant.
- **You have the right to film police** in public spaces as long as you are not interfering with their duties.
