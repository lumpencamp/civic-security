# Expanded Protest Checklist: A Guide for Activists

This checklist is designed to help you prepare for, navigate, and safely conclude your participation in a protest or direct action.

### **1. Pre-Protest Preparation (The Week Before)**

#### **Digital Security**

*   [ ] **Back Up Your Phone:** Ensure all important data (photos, contacts, documents) is backed up to a secure cloud service or a personal computer. 
*   [ ] **Enable Full-Disk Encryption:** Most modern smartphones (iOS, Android) have this enabled by default. Double-check your security settings. This makes it much harder for anyone to access your data if your phone is seized.
*   [ ] **Set a Strong Passcode:** Use a long, alphanumeric passcode instead of a simple PIN, fingerprint, or face ID. Police may be able to legally compel you to use your biometrics (finger/face) to unlock a phone, but they cannot compel you to reveal a passcode.
*   [ ] **Review Social Media Settings:** Set your accounts to private. Be mindful of what you post publicly about your intent to protest. 
*   [ ] **Secure Your Communications:** Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal for planning with other organizers. Avoid using SMS, Facebook Messenger, or other unencrypted platforms for sensitive conversations.
*   [ ] **Install a Legal Support App:** Download the ACLU "Mobile Justice" app for your state. It allows you to record and automatically upload video of police encounters to the ACLU.

#### **Physical & Group Preparation**

*   [ ] **Know Your Goal:** Understand the purpose of the protest and the plan for the day. What are you trying to achieve?
*   [ ] **Form an Affinity Group:** If possible, go with a small group of trusted friends (an "affinity group"). You can look out for each other, make decisions together, and provide support if someone is arrested.
*   [ ] **Designate a Jail Support Contact:** Choose one person who is NOT attending the protest to be your jail support contact. Give them the full names and birth dates of everyone in your affinity group. They will be your point of contact to arrange legal help and bail if you are arrested.
*   [ ] **Write Down Key Phone Numbers:** Do not rely on your phone's contact list. Write down the following numbers on your arm or a piece of paper in permanent marker:
    *   Your jail support contact.
    *   **National Lawyers Guild (NLG) Chicago Hotline: (872) 465-4244**
    *   **First Defense Legal Aid (FDLA) 24/7 Hotline: (800) 529-7374**
*   [ ] **Plan Your Route:** Know how you're getting to and from the protest. Have a backup plan. Be aware of your surroundings as you travel.

### **2. The Day of the Protest**

#### **What to Wear**

*   [ ] **Comfortable, Sturdy Shoes:** You will be on your feet for hours. Closed-toe shoes are essential.
*   [ ] **Layers of Plain Clothing:** Wear non-descript clothing without logos or political messages (beyond the protest's core message, if desired). Layers allow you to adapt to changing weather and can be removed to change your appearance if needed.
*   [ ] **Weather-Appropriate Gear:** Bring a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, or a rain poncho as needed.
*   [ ] **Face Covering:** A mask (like a disposable medical mask or a cloth mask), scarf, or bandana can help protect your identity from surveillance and protect you from airborne irritants.

#### **What NOT to Wear**

*   **Contact Lenses:** Chemical agents like pepper spray can get trapped under them, causing severe eye damage. Wear glasses instead.
*   **Jewelry:** It can be grabbed or get caught on things.
*   **Makeup or Oily Lotions:** These can trap chemical agents against your skin.

#### **What to Bring (Safety & First Aid)**

*   [ ] **Water in a Plastic Bottle:** Stay hydrated. Avoid glass bottles.
*   [ ] **Snacks:** High-energy snacks like granola bars.
*   [ ] **Personal First-Aid Kit:** Include bandages, antiseptic wipes, and any personal medications (e.g., inhaler). 
*   [ ] **Liquid Antacid & Water Solution:** A 50/50 mix of liquid antacid (like Maalox) and water in a spray bottle can be used to flush eyes exposed to pepper spray. Label it clearly.
*   [ ] **Cash:** For food, transport, or payphones. 
*   [ ] **ID (Optional but Recommended):** In Illinois, you are not required to carry ID, but not having it can complicate and prolong the arrest process. If you bring it, keep it separate from your wallet.

### **3. During the Protest**

*   [ ] **Stay with Your Group:** Keep your affinity group close. Use a buddy system.
*   [ ] **Stay Aware:** Pay attention to your surroundings. Note the locations of street medics, legal observers (often in bright green hats), and police.
*   [ ] **Stay Calm:** A calm and clear head is your best tool. 
*   [ ] **Document:** If it is safe to do so, film police activity, especially arrests or use of force. Narrate what you are seeing, including badge numbers, street signs, and the time.

### **4. Post-Protest Actions**

#### **Immediate Actions**

*   [ ] **Leave Safely:** Leave with your group or a buddy. Avoid leaving alone. Be aware that police may follow or monitor people leaving the area.
*   [ ] **Change Your Appearance:** If you are concerned about being followed, consider removing an outer layer of clothing or changing your headwear to alter your appearance.
*   [ ] **Power Off Your Phone:** Turn your phone off immediately after leaving the protest area and don't turn it back on until you are somewhere safe. This prevents location tracking.

#### **Debriefing & Follow-Up**

*   [ ] **Group Debrief:** Meet with your affinity group in a safe place. Discuss what happened, how everyone is feeling, and if anyone needs support.
*   [ ] **Check on Arrestees:** If anyone from your group was arrested, your jail support contact should be working to locate them and secure legal help. Follow up and provide support.
*   [ ] **Secure Your Data:** Once home, upload any photos or videos you took to a secure computer or cloud storage and then delete them from your phone.

#### **Checking for Surveillance**

*   [ ] **Vary Your Routes:** In the days following a high-profile action, avoid taking the same route to and from home, work, or school.
*   [ ] **Pay Attention:** Be aware of unfamiliar vehicles parked on your street for long periods or individuals you don't recognize who appear to be observing your home.
*   [ ] **Digital Check-Up:** Be cautious of suspicious emails or social media messages (phishing attempts) you may receive after the protest.
